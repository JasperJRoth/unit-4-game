        <li>When a farmer reaches a market they generate money for the player that owns them</li>
        <li>The further the farmer travelled to get to the market, the more money they make</li>

        <li>Knights move forward and generate money by pillaging buildings or killing farmers</li>
        <li>When a knight reaches the end of the board, your opponent loses money</li>
        <li>When a player has negative money, they lose the game</li>
